You need a data.xls file which has all the data of students.
The file created will be of the format month_year.xlsx.
The excel file will be created inside Entries.
The project can be tested using lib.exe.
Any required changes can be done to lib.py and then be converted into lib.exe.











Please Note: The readme is same for both the projects.
	     One project has out-time and the other does not have out-time.
	     The Header of data.xls must be in the same order. (changing the titles won't effect the project).
	     The above point is effective only if you have not done any changes to the project.
